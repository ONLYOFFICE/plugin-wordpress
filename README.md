# WordPress plugin

The WordPress plugin allows users to publish documents as articles on their WordPress websites directly from the document editor. The Save as Draft option allows publishing the created content later. In this case, the article will be available in the Drafts tab of the Blog Posts section on your WordPress website. Images, autoshapes, and tables cannot be transferred to WordPress due to inner specifics.

The plugin is pre-installed in ONLYOFFICE Enterprise Edition, Community Edition (Document Server + Community Server), ONLYOFFICE cloud service, and ONLYOFFICE Personal.

## How to use

In the Cloud Service and ONLYOFFICE Personal, you just need to log in to your WordPress account in the plugin within the document editor. To configure WordPress in the server solutions, you have to get the WordPress authorization key.

To publish any document on your WordPress website:

1. Click the Plugins icon on the left sidebar and find the WordPress plugin.
2. Click the Connect button.
3. Give any title to your article and click the Publish button.
